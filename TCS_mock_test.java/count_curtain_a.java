A furnishing company is manufacturing a new collection of curtains. The curtains are of two colors aqua(a) and black (b). The curtains' color is represented as a string(str) consisting of a’s and b’s of length N.



Then, they are packed (substring) into L number of curtains in each box. The box with the maximum number of ‘aqua’ (a) color curtains is labeled. The task here is to find the number of ‘aqua’ color curtains in the labeled box.



Note :



If ‘L’ is not a multiple of N, the remaining number of curtains should be considered as a substring too. In simple words, after dividing the curtains into sets of ‘L’, any curtains left will be another set(refer to example 1).



Example 1:

Input :

bbbaaababa -> Value of str

3    -> Value of L

Output:

3   -> Maximum number of a’s

Explanation:

From the input given above.

Dividing the string into sets of 3 characters each 

Set 1: {b,b,b}

Set 2: {a,a,a}

Set 3: {b,a,b}

Set 4: {a} -> leftover characters also as taken as another set

Among all the sets, Set 2 has more number of a’s. The number of a’s in set 2 is 3.

Hence, the output is 3.



Example 2:

Input :

abbbaabbb -> Value of str

5   -> Value of L

Output:

2   -> Maximum number of a’s

Explanation:

From the input given above,

Dividing the string into sets of 5 characters each.

Set 1: {a,b,b,b,b}

Set 2: {a,a,b,b,b}

Among both the sets, set 2 has more number of a’s. The number of a’s in set 2 is 2.

Hence, the output is 2.

Input format :
The first line contains a string str representing the colors of the curtains (composed of 'a's and 'b's).

The second line contains an integer L, representing the number of curtains in each box.

Output format :
The output displays an integer representing the maximum number of 'a's in any labeled box.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ Length of str ≤ 100

1 ≤ L ≤ Length of str

The string str contains only lowercase letters 'a' and 'b'.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
bbbaaababa
3
Output 1 :
3
Input 2 :
abbbaabbb
5
Output 2 :
2
